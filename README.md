This is a file conversion API where you can convert video, audio, and other file types.

To properly operate the API:

1. Clone the repository directly in the xampp's htdocs folder.
2. Unzip the CmdTools.zip folder.
3. Drag the three executable files directly in the C:\ directory.
4. Go to the .env file to add your AWS credentials.
